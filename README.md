## Instructions

The goal of the Memory Game is to find pairs of the same card (i.e. match an airplane card with the other airplane card). There are 8 pairs to match, with 16 cards mixed randomly from the user to click on. When you click on a card it will present as blue until it has found it's match. When a match is made both cards will become green. Only two cards can be opened at once and if they do not match, both cards will flip back over within a few seconds. 

There is a timer that will begin when the first card is clicked and will end when all 8 matches have been found. There is also a move counter and a star rating. Each click on a card will count as a move. There is no limit to how many moves you can make. However, after a certain number of moves, the star rating will drop by one with the lowest rating being one star. 

When all cards have been matched, the user will see a popup on the screen that summarizes their game. The popup will include how many moves were made, total time for the game, and the final star rating. Additionally, the popup will offer the player the option to play the game again or close the popup and end gameplay. 

If the user is actively playing a game but would like to restart the game or closes the popup accidently but still wants to play, there is a restart button which will clear the gameboard, shuffle the cards, reset the timer, and reset the star rating.
